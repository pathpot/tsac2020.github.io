Thai student academic conference (TSAC) has been annually organized since 2012 by Thai students in Europe
For the year 2020, the office of science and technology at the Royal Thai Embassy in Brussels, together with the representatives of Thai students from the countries in Europe, agree to organize the 9th Thai Student Conference in Europe (TSAC2020) between 7 - 9 May 2020 in Bonn, Germany
TSAC2020 will be organized under the theme of  "Living in the digital transformation era", the era in which everybody should be aware of rapid technological change
This awareness, including the global economic competition and the preparation of knowledge and personnel to be ready for the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) policy, should be introduced to the Thai people.

The theme of TSAC2020 is in line with the 20-year national strategic plan (2018 - 2037)
The main objective of TSAC2020 is to share knowledge and to create innovative cooperation between Thai students, the organizations both in Thailand and in Europe
The outcome of the conference may result in collaboration between relevant organizations in the future.

Germany is a country that uses technology and innovation to add value to products and services
Most of the country's income comes from the automotive and medical device industries
There is also a synergy between the universities, research centers from the public and private sectors and industries
This collaborative framework helps Germany to become one of the potential competitors in the global market with modern-technology driven products


This academic conference (TSAC2020) will be held in Germany
It was scheduled for presentations from universities, research centers and industries from Germany
The conference outcome may help to structure ideas to be adapted as policies to be applied in Thailand.

For academic presentations, participants must submit their abstracts for the selection process
The abstracts are covered in three main areas, including:
* Engineering, Science, Chemistry, Information Technology, Mathematics, and statistics
* Medicine, Biotechnology, Agriculture
* Human behavior, Economic, Social science, Political science, Law, Business, Finance, Music, and Art

The abstracts will be selected by a committee consisting of researchers, academics, and senior professionals in particular areas
The abstract with clear motivations and objectives, as well as reasonable research methods, will be selected for either oral presentation or poster presentation.

The objectives of TSAC2020 are:
* To motivate Thai students in Europe to be aware of their cooperation as students for Thai society and economic growth as well as to prepare themselves for the global community.
* To support the academic success of Thai students in Europe
* To maintain a network and academic partnership between students in different academic and social backgrounds for the great benefit of Thailand in the future.
